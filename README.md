## Overview

This project is a **web application for image enhancement** using the **SCI (Stable Contextual Image Enhancement) deep learning model**. It enhances low-light or low-quality images to improve brightness, contrast, and details, making them visually clearer and more appealing.

The app is built with **Streamlit** for a simple user interface and uses a **pretrained SCI model** for fast and accurate image enhancement without needing any training.

## Features

- Upload low-quality images (JPEG, PNG)
- Real-time image enhancement using the SCI model
- Display original and enhanced images side-by-side
- Download enhanced images
- Runs on CPU (no GPU required)
